# Anodyne-2-Script

The english script for Anodyne 2.
This is the formatted-for-engine version. There's a raw text version with various comments but I want to look over those before making them public.

... This is also probably a good time to mention the writing credits!

While we do collaborate on the plot/story structure to an extent (for example: the structure of the world being concentric rings. Or, Marina came up with the idea of some kind of Dustbound arc, but we worked together to decide it should be 2D), Marina was the main writer for this game, so I'll just mention what I wrote specifically - everything else was Marina!

- Part of the introductory message
- Drifting Pollen NPCs, nano assassin texts
- Bran Maligden (2D NPCs only), Misteria Waizel (2D NPCs), tongue area 2D NPCs, Gwom 2D NPCs

- Golden Orb/Minorma
- 'producer tani' (after dustdra fight)
- shesez/nitro rad easter eggs

- A little bit of CV's speech explaining Metaclean
- the kid in the desert giving a hint (lol)
- text where nova overlooks the dust storm after the Dustbound arc
